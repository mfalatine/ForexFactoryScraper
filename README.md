## üîç EventCrawler - Event Type Mapping Tool

The EventCrawler is a specialized script that collects comprehensive event type mappings from ForexFactory to enable accurate event classification.

### Running EventCrawler

**Prerequisites**: Node.js installed on your system

**Command**:
```bash
node eventcrawler.js
```

**What it does**:
- Collects event type mappings for a full year (August 2024 - August 2025)
- Processes all 10 event type filters individually (Growth, Inflation, Employment, Central Bank, Bonds, Housing, Consumer, Business, Speeches, Misc)
- Extracts `event_name`, `ebase_id`, `event_type` from each event
- Outputs comprehensive mapping data to `event_mappings.csv`
- Takes approximately 4+ minutes to complete (120 API requests with 2-second delays)
- Includes progress tracking, error handling, and retry logic

**Output**: Creates `event_mappings.csv` with definitive ForexFactory event classifications that can be used to add accurate event type columns to the main application.

**Usage**: Run this script periodically to update event type mappings or when you need comprehensive event classification data.
